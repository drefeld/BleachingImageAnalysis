In the study, adult coral fragments of *Montipora digitata* were exposed to different concentrations of chemical substances. To assess concentration-dependent bleaching responses, photos of the fragments were taken at the beginning and at the end of the experiment with the same camera settings and lighting conditions. The resulting images were pre-processed in the open-source photography workflow application [darktable](https://www.darktable.org/) before being analyzed with the open-source image analysis platform ImageJ ([Fiji distribution](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2019)). The supplementary material includes:

1. An image analysis manual that show all steps from image pre-processing with darktable to image analysis in ImageJ.
2. An ImageJ Macro that allows quick semi-automatic processing of coral fragment images.

Please cite the article if you use any of the available information to create your own image analysis workflow.
